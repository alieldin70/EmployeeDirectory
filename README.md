# EmployeeDirectory
A simple employee management system using Spring Boot allows businesses to efficiently organize and oversee their workforce.
Employee Entity: The core of the system revolves around the Employee entity, which typically includes attributes such as:
ID: A unique identifier for each employee.
Name: The employee's full name.
Email: Contact email address.
Role: The position or role within the organization.
Additional attributes salary, hire date, etc., can also be included based on requirements.
Database Interaction: Spring Data JPA simplifies the interaction with the database by providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations out of the box. This allows seamless storage and retrieval of employee data from a relational database such as MySQL 

Service Layer: The service layer contains the business logic for managing employees. It encapsulates operations such as adding new employees, updating existing records, retrieving employee details, and deleting employee records. This layer ensures separation of concerns and promotes code reusability.

RESTful API: The system exposes RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD operations on employee data. These endpoints enable external clients (e.g., web applications, mobile apps) to interact with the system. Typical endpoints include:
GET /api/employee: Retrieve a list of all employees.
GET /api/employee/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific employee.
GET /api/employee/salary/{salary}: Retrieve a list of  employees with a spacified salary.
GET /api/employee/hiredate: Retrieve a list of  employees with a spacified hiredate.
POST/api/employee: Add a new employee.
PUT /api/employee/{id}: Update details of an existing employee.
DELETE /api/employee/{id}: Delete an employee record.
DELETE /api/employee: Delete all employees

Database Configuration: Spring Boot simplifies database configuration through properties files ( application.properties). Configuration parameters such as database URL, username, password, and driver class can be specified here.

Error Handling: robust error handling mechanisms provide meaningful error messages in case of invalid requests or server errors.

Testing: Unit tests ensure the correctness of individual components such as repositories, services, and controllers. clientTools like postman facilitate writing and executing tests to validate the behavior of the system under different scenarios.
